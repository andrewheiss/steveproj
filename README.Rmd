`{steveproj}` is an R package to help you start and manage R projects with an eye toward producing an academic project (to culminate in an academic paper). The package is in development and will incorporate other packages in my eponymous R ecosystem, prominently [`{stevetemplates}`](https://github.com/svmiller/stevetemplates). The package itself leans primarily on Rstudio and how it creates/manages projects. The creation a project in Rstudio, through `{steveproj}`, will result in a new directory containing subdirectories for rendering documents (`src`), R scripts for analysis (`R`), finished data objects (`data`), and finished reports (`doc`). An accompanying `Makefile` and R Markdown file will assist in the management and production of the project.

## Installation

When the time comes, you can install this on CRAN.

```r
install.packages("steveproj")
```

Right now, this package in development and is not available on CRAN. You can install the development version of `steveproj` from Github via the `devtools` package. I suppose using the `remotes` package would work as well.

```r
devtools::install_github("svmiller/steveproj")
```

## Usage

My website will have a more exhaustive tutorial for using this package and all that comes in it. For now, a user maximize their experience with `{steveproj}` through either the console or Rstudio.

### Console

Assume the current working directory is something like `/home/steve/Dropbox/projects` (as it is for me). Then, a user can create a new project with the `create_project()` command.

```{r, eval=F}
steveproj::create_project("dissertation")
```

This will create a new directory in the working directory, titled "dissertation", that includes a skeleton of a research project to assist the user in getting started on their academic paper/project. That directory will be located in the current working directory. The only downside to the console approach over the Rstudio approach is the console approach won't create an `.Rproj` file in the directory. The Rstudio approach will.

You could optionally combine this command line call in the console with the following command, which will add an `.Rproj` file to the directory you just created

```{r, eval=F}
# steveproj::create_project("dissertation")
# ^ assume you just ran this
# Then, do this next
steveproj::create_rproj("dissertation")
```

### Rstudio

Go to *File > New Project*. You'll see a prompt that looks like this. Select "New Directory".

![](inst/README/steveproj-1.png)

That will direct you here. Scroll down your available project types until you see my "S" icon, which is incidentally the favicon on [my website](http://svmiller.com). Select that entry to create a new academic paper/project.

![](inst/README/steveproj-2.png)

That will direct you here. Enter the name of the directory you want to create. Click "Create Project" when you're done. This will create a new directory, titled whatever you entered in the directory name, along with an `.Rproj` file. By default, it will also open a new Rstudio session.
